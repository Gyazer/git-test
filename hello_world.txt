Yo what's good. If you're reading this you've stumbled upon my first GitHub repo, like ever. 
I'm typing this at nearly 3am, I have work later today but always leave this learning to code stuff for later.
Honestly I'm really trying to stick to it this time.
Learning LUA was a pain, and learning stuff directly from a book isn't really helpful.
Plus it just seems so corporate, TOP really feels like it's a real community.
Like it's a real being talking me through everything and encouraging me at every point.
I hope I can pull through, and I wish whoever is reading this a wonderful day, night, weekend.
Whatever it may be.


p.s. Watch One Piece :D
