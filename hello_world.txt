Yo what's good. If you're reading this you've stumbled upon my first GitHub repo, like ever. 
I'm typing this at nearly 3am, I have work later today but always leave this learning to code stuff for later.
Honestly I'm really trying to stick to it this time.
Learning LUA was a pain, and learning stuff directly from a book isn't really helpful.
Plus it just seems so corporate, TOP really feels like it's a real community.
Like it's a real being talking me through everything and encouraging me at every point.
It so far seems to be the most detailed and dedicated project for teaching people to code.
I've tried CodeCademy, and really liked it too, being able to write code within the website is so nice.
Overall it was aesthetically pleasing and portrayed information so well.
Truly, though, TOP sets you up for a real career. It doesn't hand hold you by giving you your own text editor and output to write in.
You set everything up yourself, BEFORE you begin learning ANYTHING.
You dedicate yourself before you've written even a single line of code.
I hope I can pull through, and I wish whoever is reading this a wonderful day, night, weekend.
Whatever it may be.


p.s. Watch One Piece :D
